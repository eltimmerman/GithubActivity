Mia goes on walks everyday. Today she went on a walk at dusk. She starts her walk in the woods by her house. As she walks she notices a new path that she has never seen before. She decides to explore it.

As she walks deeper and deeper into the woods, the trees become much more dense and dark. Suddenly, she starts hearing branches and twigs start snapping around her, however, it doesn't bother her. She keeps going, curious as to what the path could lead to. However, it was starting to get dark, and soon enough, she could barely see her hand in front of her face. 

She starts running as fast as she can, becuase she knows of the monsters that come out at night. She sprints through the lush forest hoping to see an end. As she runs she sees a small speck of light. She runs towards it the light gets bigger and bigger. She ran through the light , and there was a whole new world in front of her, and a new adventure was about to begin.
